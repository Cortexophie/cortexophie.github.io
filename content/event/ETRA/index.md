- My coauthor, [Joe MacInnes] (https://www.swansea.ac.uk/staff/william.macinnes/), will be presenting our paper in my stead because of my inability to travel to the UK. Thank you, Joe! If you are at ETRA or just passing by, check out Joe's talk on June 5th at Paper Session 1: Visual Attention starting at 11 am.
