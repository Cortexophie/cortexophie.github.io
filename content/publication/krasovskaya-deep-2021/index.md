abstract: Approximately twenty years ago, Laurent Itti and Christof Koch created a
  model of saliency in visual attention in an attempt to recreate the work of biological
  pyramidal neurons by mimicking neurons with centre-surround receptive fields. The
  Saliency Model has launched many studies that contributed to the understanding of
  layers of vision and the sphere of visual attention. The aim of the current study
  is to improve this model by using an artificial neural network as the spatial component
  of a model that generates saccades similar to how humans make saccadic eye movements.
  The proposed model uses a Leaky Integrate-and-Fire layer for temporal predictions,
  and replaces parallel feature maps with a deep learning neural network in order
  to create a generative model that is precise for both spatial and temporal shifts
  of attention. Our model was able to predict eye movements based on unsupervised
  learning from raw image input, combined with supervised learning from fixation maps
  retrieved during an eye-tracking experiment. The results imply that it is possible
  to match the spatial and temporal distributions of the model to spatial and temporal
  human distributions.
