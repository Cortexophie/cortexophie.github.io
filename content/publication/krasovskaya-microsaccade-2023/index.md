abstract: 'Microsaccades belong to the category of fixational micromovements and may
  be crucial for image stability on the retina. Eye movement paradigms typically require fixational
  control, but this does not eliminate all oculomotor activity. The antisaccade task
  requires a planned eye movement in the direction opposite of an onset, allowing
  separation of planning and execution. We build on previous studies of microsaccades
  in the antisaccade task using a combination of fixed and mixed pro- and antisaccade
  blocks. We hypothesized that microsaccade rates may be reduced prior to the execution
  of antisaccades as compared with regular saccades (prosaccades). In two experiments,
  we measured microsaccades in four conditions across three trial blocks: one block
  each of fixed prosaccade and antisaccade trials, and a mixed block where both saccade
  types were randomized. We anticipated that microsaccade rates would be higher prior
  to antisaccades than prosaccades due to the need to preemptively suppress reflexive
  saccades during antisaccade generation. In Experiment 1, with monocular eye tracking,
  there was an interaction between the effects of saccade and block type on microsaccade
  rates, suggesting lower rates on antisaccade trials, but only within mixed blocks.
  In Experiment 2, eye tracking was binocular, revealing suppressed microsaccade rates
  on antisaccade trials. A cluster permutation analysis of the microsaccade rate over
  the course of a trial did not reveal any particular critical time for this difference
  in microsaccade rates. Our findings suggest that microsaccade rates reflect the
  degree of suppression of the oculomotor system during the antisaccade task.'
